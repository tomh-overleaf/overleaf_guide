# Understanding the Overleaf Interface {.sec-interface}

Once you've created a new project, you'll see the Overleaf editor interface, which consists of:

* Text Editor: The left-hand panel where you write your LaTeX code.
* Preview Pane: The right-hand panel where you can see a live preview of your document as you write.
* Toolbar: Located at the top of the editor, it contains buttons for common actions such as compiling, saving, and sharing your document.
