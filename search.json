While it is not a super powerful text editor, its ease of use and collaboration features make it a favorite among many users. In fact, many graduate students and professors prefer Overleaf over all other editors.\nThis starter guide will walk you through getting started in Overleaf, from signing up for an account, to creating projects, collaborating, and much more.",

    "text": "These instructions are for projects that are hosted on GitHub, not those that just exist on Overleaf. In other words, we want you to use Overleaf as if it were an IDE for editing TeX files, not as a file storage suite as Google Docs may be. This will make it so that 1) you can collaborate with others who do not use overleaf, 2) you can keep a consistent repository space (GitHub) for all of your projects, and 3) your LaTeX files can live in the same repository as your data, etc.\nTo create a fully new project in Overleaf (and connecting it to GitHub):\n\nAfter logging in, you can create a new project by clicking on the “New Project” button. You’ll be presented with options to start from a blank document, choose from various templates (such as research papers, presentations, CVs, etc.), or upload an existing LaTeX project.\nYou can press the Overleaf project “Menu” button on the top left (next to the home symbol).\nThen, under “Sync”, you can press “GitHub”.\nIt will pop-up with “Export Project to GitHub” and ask you to enter a repository name. When you complete the fields, press “Create a GitHub repository”\nIn the future when you edit, you can commit changes with “Push Overleaf changes to GitHub”\n\nTo import an already existing project from GitHub:\n\nClick “Create a New Project” and then select “Import from GitHub”\nIf this is your first time trying, you will have to click on the pop-up “Link to your GitHub account”\nSign into your GitHub account when you are redirected there.\nIt will redirect you back to Overleaf, and will tell you it was successfully linked.\n\nYou may also want to link to your Dropbox account at this screen, if you have one!\n\nNow, when you click “New Project”, it will show you a list of repositories that you have access to that you can import to Overleaf\nAfter you edit your file, and you are ready to commit it to the GitHub repository:\n\nYou can press the Overleaf project “Menu” button on the top left (next to the home symbol).\nThen, under “Sync”, you can press “GitHub”.\nA pop-up will appear. You can then press “Push Overleaf changes to GitHub”\nWrite your commit message & press “Commit”",

The main content of your document is enclosed between \\begin{document} and \\end{document} tags.\nSections and Subsections: Use commands like \\section{} and \\subsection{} to organize your document into sections and subsections.\nText Formatting: Apply formatting such as bold, italics, and underline using commands like \\textbf{}, \\textit{}, and \\underline{} respectively.\nLists: Create itemized or numbered lists using the itemize or enumerate environments.\nMath Equations: LaTeX excels at typesetting mathematical equations. Use the $ … $ or [ … ] delimiters for inline or displayed equations respectively.\nFigures and Tables: Insert figures and tables using the and table environments respectively.",
